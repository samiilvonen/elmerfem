! This is a test case for testing out FilmFlowSolver for 2D channel flow.
! The channel has a variable height. The velocity presents the average
! flow velocity. With the same average models the 2D and 3D models should
! produce close to the same pressure drop (computed by SaveScalars). 
!
! This case with flow initiated by a given "bedrock height".
!
! This case comes with 3 different viscosity models:
! "laminar" (default), "darcy" and "manning".
